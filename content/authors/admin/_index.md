Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the [Harvardâ€“MIT Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/) program advised by [Isaac Kohane](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/isaac-kohane) and supported by the [National Science Foundation GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org). My research focus is in harnessing physiological signals and observational health data to enhance clinical decision-making and understand disease heterogeneity. My ongoing work concentrates on using continuous glucose monitoring to enable precision medicine for patients with type 2 diabetes. 

\ Previously, I graduated *magna cum laude* from Harvard College with a degree in Electrical Engineering where I worked on biomedical control for the artificial pancreas.
